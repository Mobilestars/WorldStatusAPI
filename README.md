# WorldStatusAPI

WorldStatusAPI is a lightweight **PlaceholderAPI expansion** that lets you display the **online status of your BungeeCord servers** directly in-game.  

Use placeholders like `%bungeeserver_world_status%` to show the status of your **world** server or `%bungeeserver_mini_games_status%` to show the status of your **mini_games** server. These placeholders can be used in **Holograms**, **Scoreboards**, **TAB**, **chat messages**, or any other **PlaceholderAPI-compatible plugin**.

The plugin automatically checks your configured servers every few seconds and updates the placeholders to show **Online** or **Offline**, so players can always see which servers are currently available.

This plugin has only been tested on **Minecraft 1.21.X**, but it is likely compatible with other versions as well.
